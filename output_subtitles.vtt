00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:03.003
Welcome to Practical

2
00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:06.306
Multi AI Agents
and Advanced Use Cases with CrewAI.

3
00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:10.477
This is a very practical course,
meaning you hear about and learn

4
00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:14.714
how to build yourself agentic systems
that aren't just shiny technology,

5
00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:18.985
but they can be deployed and create
real value and application settings

6
00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:24.219
right now. Multi AI Agent systems
involve multiple AI agents working together

7
00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:29.958
to achieve complex tasks by collaborating,
delegating, and sharing information.

8
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.067
If you took the previous
multi-AI agent systems course,

9
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.071
you learn that multiple agents
can be created, each with specific tasks

10
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:42.542
or roles, and these agents can collaborate
to perform complex workflows.

11
00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:47.480
In this course, you'll learn how to build
agent-based apps for even more advanced

12
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.917
use cases,
and you see numerous real use cases

13
00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:53.887
based on what
people are actually doing in practice.

14
00:00:54.087 --> 00:00:57.957
When you're building multi-agent
applications, a key challenge is balancing

15
00:00:57.957 --> 00:01:02.829
the speed and quality of results
while also maintaining consistency.

16
00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:06.666
Different model choices
and sizes can impact these factors.

17
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:11.137
In this course, you'll learn to rigorously
test your application by measuring

18
00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:15.241
key metrics that you can then use
to keep on driving further improvements.

19
00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:19.112
You'll also learn to train your agents
using human feedback

20
00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:22.182
to keep on improving your application over
time.

21
00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:26.653
It's my pleasure to be here with Joao Moura,
who is founder of CrewAI

22
00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:29.656
and Joao will be your instructor
for this course.

23
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.694
Joao also taught the previous course
on Multi AI Agent Systems,

24
00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:35.795
welcome back.

25
00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:37.163
Thank you so much.

26
00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:39.065
so good to be back here with you.

27
00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:42.502
And with this new practical course
on multi-agent systems.

28
00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:47.073
We're seeing so many companies
building multi-agent AI applications,

29
00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:51.544
running in aggregate,
tens of millions of agents using CrewAI.

30
00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:55.014
And creating more complex agent workflows
that involve

31
00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:58.751
multiple agents
working parallel, multiple crews as well,

32
00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.123
and doing so much rigorous performance
testing and training steps.

33
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.827
So, Joao, in the previous course
you had explained and demonstrated

34
00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:11.498
the basic building blocks
of multi-agent systems, things

35
00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:15.368
like how agents can work together
on the tasks, how they can use tools,

36
00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:17.871
how you can build
some really cool applications

37
00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:19.973
with relatively few lines of code.

38
00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.741
Maybe you can say a bit about what

39
00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:23.977
learners can look forward to
in this course.

40
00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:28.014
Sure, we will start with a quick review
of agentic systems.

41
00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:31.484
You will then learn
how to integrate your multi-agent

42
00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:34.521
automation
with internal and external systems.

43
00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:38.725
This enables your app to perform actions
like query internal data,

44
00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:42.862
calling existing systems, sending emails,
and so much more.

45
00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:48.596
Next, you'll learn how to create a variety
of crew setups from sequential

46
00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:53.139
to parallel and anything in between,
including a few hybrid setups.

47
00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:56.409
You will learn
how to run tasks in parallel,

48
00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.479
and also how to connect
multiple crews in the pipeline.

49
00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:03.249
Then we will look at how you can optimize
the performance

50
00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:07.020
of your multi-agent systems
using testing and training methods.

51
00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:10.356
After that, you will learn how to create
crews that

52
00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:14.093
employ multiple different LLM models
to complete a task.

53
00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:18.965
For example, you could have a researcher
agent using a smaller and faster model

54
00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:23.836
for a relatively simple task,
and the writer agent using a large model

55
00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:27.273
that has been fine tuned
to reflect your company's brand voice.

56
00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:31.044
I will be referring to this
as a multi-model approach

57
00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:35.815
that lets you mix and match multiple
LLM models based on the task at hand,

58
00:03:36.115 --> 00:03:39.886
which can help you build a more efficient
and customized AI system.

59
00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:43.823
Many people have worked to create this
course.

60
00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:48.061
I'd like to thank the whole CrewAI
team and from DeepLearning.AI,

61
00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:52.732
Esmaeil Gargari and Geoff Ladwig
have also contributed to this course.

62
00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:55.835
This course is going to be a lot of fun.

63
00:03:55.835 --> 00:04:00.673
You will build several practical apps
like an automated project planning, lead

64
00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:02.942
scoring and engagement automation

65
00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:06.346
support, data
analysis and content creation at scale.

66
00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:11.084
I've really enjoyed using CrewAI myself
and I'm confident that you will too.

67
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:13.720
Let's
go on to the next video to get started.
